User-comprehensible TODOs:
-Add restart command, restricted to mods
-Restrict joining/leaving other players to mods
--Require a setup command before the bot becomes active? e.g. to specify which role is the "mod" role?
-Come up with a better name for the bot.
-Add support for slash commands (blocked until discord.py or related library adds support)
-Make among-us-voice-text only visible to the people in the voice chat.
-Fix release notes messages
-Include all past release notes in release notes message if the bot is starting on a new Discord
-Update latest version message if release notes have changes
-Add TODO list to a pinned bot channel message
-Suggest new members join the Among Us role.
-When a new game command is sent:
--Mute all players in among us voice chat
--Send the TTS message
--Unmute any players that weren't already muted
-Among Us integration?
-Twitch chat integration
--Optionally sync a channel with a twitch chat
-Steam integration
-When multiple users are added/removed in a single command, consolidate them into a single log/message to reduce notifications
-When multiple users add themselves within the same timespan (e.g. 5 minutes), send only a single message to reduce notifications
-When the bot restarts, check the bot's nickname and update channel topics/descriptions accordingly.
-Automatically delete new game messages after some set amount of time (~12? hours)?
-Mention channels in more of the log messages (instead of simply naming them)
-(one-off) Send pizza to notk's #general
-Point new users to the rules
-Request pizza from new members.
-Update the Discord status of the bot to show how many servers it is serving.
-Send a daily/weekly bible verse to a channel

Technical/development TODOs:
-Modify production deployment script to deploy a specific release instead of the current directory.
-Generalize RoleEnroller
-Detect when an important role/channel has been deleted and handle robustly
-Move developer information to config file (andrewf#6219)
-During build process, run a python script to parse the test/production config files, remove any default values, and overwrite the initial config file with the result. Also produce a variant with all non-specified config options set to their default values as a form of documentation.
-Create wrapper around client/bot with additional utility/convenience functions
-Solve never-retrieved task exceptions
