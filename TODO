User-comprehensible TODOs:
-Update the status of the bot to show how many servers it is serving.
-Come up with a better name for the bot.
-Restrict joining/leaving other players to mods
--Require a setup command before the bot becomes active? e.g. to specify which role is the "mod" role?
-When multiple users are added/removed in a single command, consolidate them into a single log/message to reduce notifications
-When multiple users add themselves within the same timespan (e.g. 5 minutes), send only a single message to reduce notifications
-Prompt new members to join the Among Us role.
-Request pizza from new members.
-(one-off) Send pizza to notk's #general

Technical/development TODOs:
-Improve setup/start
-Move developer information to config file
-Cache members. Alternatively, remove support for non-tagged members in join/leave commands
-Fix instructional message update
--Update the instructional message by editing instead of replacing
-Enable multiple versions to run on the same server (so test and production can run simultaneously without paying for another server)
--Alternatively, get set up to run test version from my PC/home server
-Reorganize file structure.
