User-comprehensible TODOs:
-Update the status of the bot to show how many servers it is serving.
-Come up with a better name for the bot.
-Restrict joining/leaving other players to mods
--Require a setup command before the bot becomes active? e.g. to specify which role is the "mod" role?
-When multiple users are added/removed in a single command, consolidate them into a single log/message to reduce notifications
-When multiple users add themselves within the same timespan (e.g. 5 minutes), send only a single message to reduce notifications
-Prompt new members to join the Among Us role.
-Request pizza from new members.
-(one-off) Send pizza to notk's #general
-Rename "among-us" role to "crewmates"?
-Mention channels in more of the log messages (instead of simply naming them)
-Point new users to the rules

Technical/development TODOs:
-Automated tests
-Improve setup/start
-Move command processing into GuildBot class
-Move developer information to config file
-Cache members. Alternatively, remove support for non-tagged members in join/leave commands
-Fix instructional message update
--Update the instructional message by editing instead of replacing
-Generalize RoleEnroller
-Move lists of deployment files from scripts to dedicated file list files
